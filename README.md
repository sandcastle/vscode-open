# Open with Default Application (WSL supported)

> Opens files using the OS's (in Windows for WSL) default program for the file type

 - This is forked version of [open by sandcastle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sandcastle.vscode-open) with WSL support added

## Install

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and narrow down the list commands by typing `extension`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extension`.

Simply pick the `open` extension from the list.

## Usage

### Open Shortcut

The extension can also be executed on demand

- **Mac**: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>
- **Windows**: <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>

The command could also be found in the command palette (named `Open with default application`), or on the contextual menu in the file explorer.

## Roadmap

- Add support for selecting browser (feel free to send PR)

Have fun! :beers:
